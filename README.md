Automation is something that I don't have to do, and I get to be the first to tell my boss when it's done.

It's automated as long as I don't have to do it, and I still have a job.

Once created, an automate button clicks itself. If it doesn't, then it's not an automate button.
After clicking itself, it's done its job and should disappear on its own. If it doesn't disappear, then it isn't 100% automation.
